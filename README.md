Cotoami is a standalone, cross-platform note-taking application designed to help you organize scattered information into meaningful knowledge—entirely on your own device, with full offline support.

Cotoami structures your input as “Cotos” (units of information) and connects them using “Itos” (links between Cotos). By building these connections, you transform isolated notes into an interconnected web of knowledge.

One unique feature is the built-in world map, allowing you to associate any information with geographic locations—even when offline, since the map is fully included within the app (powered by [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) and [Protomaps](https://github.com/protomaps/basemaps)).

While Cotoami Remake is designed for private, offline use, it also offers a powerful collaboration option: you can connect to other users’ databases online and cooperatively edit knowledge as a team.

> Cotoami Remake is a complete reimagining of the original [Cotoami](https://github.com/cotoami/cotoami) web application, rebuilt from the ground up as a standalone desktop app for individual users who want a simple, private note-taking experience. While it retains the core concept of its predecessor, Cotoami Remake introduces entirely new features—such as integration with a built-in map and the ability to connect databases across users—making it a fundamentally different application.

## Basic Usage

In Cotoami, you can casually post anything you want to remember—just like sending a chat message or writing a microblog. Each Coto you post is saved to your timeline.

> You can write your Cotos using Markdown. Cotoami supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), allowing for familiar formatting options like tables, task lists, and more. In addition, code blocks support syntax highlighting for a wide range of programming languages.

If you find certain Cotos especially important, you can “pin” them to the Stock area for quick access.

[screeshot 2]

By linking related Cotos together with Itos, you can build a hierarchical structure of content, starting from any pinned Coto.

Cotos in the Stock area can be freely reordered within the same level, letting you arrange your key information just the way you like.
